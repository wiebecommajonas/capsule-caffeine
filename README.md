# Capsule Caffeine

Python web scraper to gather data on the caffeine content of Nespresso pod coffee.

I made a corresponding Shortcut (links: [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4f33796a6ad24dd3aa20773b33eba3a2), [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8103/)) to log caffeine directly into the iPhone Health app. In addition, there is an alternative shortcut that allows logging of multiple pods at once, if you are very into your caffeine (link: [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dd5f8b82081341c0bc7250667eca1da0)).

See this Gist for [a sample of the JSON](https://gist.github.com/atdr/5212cdd48e77021c0786561fb2063c86) found on the Nespresso site if you're interested in extending the scraper.
